# Introduction to Computer Security Course

Welcome to the "Intro to Computer Security" course! This repository contains information about the course, including three projects and one long programming assignment.

## Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer security. Topics covered include encryption, authentication, network security, and secure software development practices.

## Projects

### Project 1: Cryptography - Encrypt Plaintext to cipher text using Row Transposition Cipher

- **Objective:** Introduce students to basic cryptographic techniques.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement a Row Transposition Cipher in Python.
  - Explore the principles of public-key cryptography.
  - Analyze the security implications of different encryption algorithms.

### Project 2: Problems for Encryption and Decryption

- **Objective:** Understand and solve the problems regarding various types of cipher
- **Tasks:**
  - Solve problems to encrypt and decrpyt various types of cipher such as Row Transposition, Ceaser Cipher, Rail Fence, Playfair.
  - Fermat's Theorem, P-Table and S-Box.
  - Scam Websites.

### Project 3: SSL

- **Objective:** Design and Implement a client server secure communication using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement a client and a server that utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
  - Upon connection, the client prompts the user to enter their ID and password. 
  - The client then sends the ID and password securely to the server through the SSL connection and rest commands to be run for testing.

### Long Programming Assignment: Implement an iterative secure banking system consisting of a bank server and multiple clients (i.e., the ATMs).

- **Objective:** Design and mplement an iterative secure banking system consisting of a bank server and multiple clients (i.e., the ATMs).
- **Tasks:**
  - Public-key encryption for secure key exchange.
  - Symmetric-key encryption for secure communication.
  - User authentication using ID and password.
  - File encryption for sensitive data storage.
